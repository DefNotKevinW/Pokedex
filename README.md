## Usage
- No setup is required to use this site!
- Pokemon can be searched for using the searchbar at the top of the main page. Pokemon can be searched for by name, type, as well as their national pokemon entry id
- The displayed pokemon can also be sorted by various categories in descending/ascending order using the dropdown menus on the main page
- Clicking on a pokemon from the main page will bring up an overlay showing more relevant details
  - Furthermore, a link at the bottom of the overlay points to the bulbapedia page for that pokemon

## Roadmap
1. Add a filter for Pokemon Generation (ie. filtering for gen 1 pokemon, gen 2 pokemon... etc)
2. Clicking on an ability in the details overlay will show a description of the ability
3. Add a movelist for each pokemon in the details overlay

## Project Status
Development is currently on hold. I'm not sure when i'll start working on this again!
